# Week 11: Topic 6. Advanced arrays and iteration

## Advanced arrays and iteration

* In this topic, we are going to bring together the two concepts we introduced in the last topic. We will be using arrays and for loops together. We will also describe using nested for loops to draw grids to the canvas

## Learning Objectives
11.1. Use for loops to iterate over an array storing information about scenery.
11.2. Use string processing functions to analyse the content of strings.
11.3. Explain why coding is an iterative process involving gradual improvement of the product.

* Lesson 6.1 Advanced work with arrays
* Lesson 6.2 Nested Iteration for drawing patterns
* Lesson 6.3 More work with arrays
* Lesson 6.4 Debugging techniques
