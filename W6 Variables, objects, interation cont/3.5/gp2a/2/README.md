### The Game Project 2a – Game character ###

Use p5 drawing functions such as rect, ellipse, line, triangle and
point to draw the different states of your game character.

Write the code so that your character appears inside the box for each
state.

IMPORTANT: For each box the variables gameChar_x & gameChar_y are set to the bottom
center of the box. You must combine these variables with arithmetic to
determine the position of each shape that you draw. This will later allow
you to adjust the position of your game character.

Each state is worth two marks:

//standing front facing = 2
//jumping facing forwards = 2
//walking left = 2
//walking right = 2
//jumping left and jumping right = 2

0 marks = not a reasonable attempt
1 mark = attempted but it's messy or lacks detail
2 marks = you've used a selection of shape functions to create your game character

WARNING: Do not get too carried away. If your character takes more than 5 lines
of code to draw then you've probably over done it.
