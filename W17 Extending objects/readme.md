# Week17 Topic 9. Extending Objects
* This topic will take your knowledge of objects further, showing you how to add functionality to the properties you have been using up until now. We will also show you how to use the P5 vector object.

## Learning Objectives
* 17.1 Differentiate between functions, variables, methods and properties
* 17.2 Implement objects with methods and properties and use them to model specified problems.
* 17.3. Model enemies and platforms in a video game using objects and arrays.

### Methods: Objects which can do things

```js
var myObject = {
    value: 123,
    name: "an example Object",
    visible: true,
    drawRandomRect: function(x, y){

    }
};
```
