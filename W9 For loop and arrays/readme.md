# Week 9: For loops and arrays
* In this topic, we will introduce you to another fundamental topic in coding, the loop. You will also learn about using arrays to store collections of variables.

## Learning Objectives
* 10.1. Use arrays to store multiple values.
* 10.2. Use a for loop to run a block of code multiple times.
* 10.3. Use the index within a for loop to produce graphical patterns.
* 10.4. Access items from an array.
* 10.5. Control your workflow for optimal coding.

## 5.1: For loops
### Video: Introducing the for loop
